        <p>Something about me that I've been doing ever since I could rember is doodling in the middle of class. I scarcely
            actually draw anything outside of that. The only exception is when I'm supposed to be doing work but I got distracted
            because I started to doodle.</p>
        
        <h2>What does that mean?</h2>
        
        <p>It means I've collected quite the amount of doodles in all of my notebooks. While I'd love to be able to put them all
            here, that's not something that I can do. Mainly because I'm not proud of most of them but also because a lot of 
            the notebooks have been thrown away over the years. So the best that I'll be able to do is to show the one's I've 
            collected so far in my college notebooks.</p>
        
        <h2>How do I doodle?</h2>
        
        <p>As doodles imply, I only draw small quick things that can occupy my mind while I sit in class and half pay attention.
            There's typically a way that I like to draw and it follows a pattern typically. That pattern typically goes as follows</p>
        
       <ul>
           <li>Random shapes and vertices</li>
           <li>A certain thing that im interested in drawing: muskets, swords, masks, etc</li>
           <li>A random thing away from the thing im focused on</li>
       </ul>
        
       <h3>Some of my favorite Doodles</h3>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/wHatMoon.jpeg" alt="Probably my favorite doodle I've done"/>
                <figcaption>This one is of the series of the current thing im interested in drawing; witch hats. So far with 
                            all the ones that I've made so far, this is the one that I like the most.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/zukoTree.jpeg" alt="Dual feature"/>
            <figcaption>The tree was part of the past interest that I had and the half face is Zuko from 
                        Avatar the Last Airbender. He's someone that I draw every once in a while(Only the scarred
                        half of his face).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/rose.jpeg" alt="A simple Rose"/>
            <figcaption>The rose is in the same boat as Zuko. It's never my special interest for drawings, but I will
                        draw them again and again.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/coolAhhJit.jpeg" alt="Just a Cool guy"/>
            <figcaption>This one has no meaning. I just thought it'd be fun to draw a worm coming out an apple but the worm is 
                        also wearing a cowboy hat and glasses. Just a cool little guy.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/finger.jpeg" alt="No real story behind this one"/>
            <figcaption>I think I read something that described a nail cutting through someones flesh the previous night before 
                        I drew this. So, in class the next day that was what I drew.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/witch.jpeg" alt="One of 2 hats with Witches in them"/>
            <figcaption>Part of the early days of the witch hats and is actually the first one that I ever made. One of the only
                         ones where I ever cared enough to actually let a witch wear it.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/carlWheezeer.jpeg" alt="One of the dumbest things I've ever made"/>
            <figcaption>Not actually sure what led me to draw this in class instead of paying attention. Here we are though
                        with this abomination born into the world.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/demonWitch.jpeg" alt="2nd of the hats that have a witch with them"/>
            <figcaption>Unfortunately one of the most detailed faces I've ever drawn. If you couldn't tell I don't really 
                        like doing them that much. It's a major reason that I don't give the hats a witch anymore. The only
                        exception to my face clause is Zuko and apparently Carl Wheezer. I think the inspiration behind this
                        particular witch was me reminicising about watching <i>Star Versus the Forces of Evil</i>.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/orbs.jpeg" alt="Part of the Orb Series"/>
            <figcaption>Not the best or most detailed drawings I've ever done, but there's sometihng about the way they 
                        look that tickle something in my brain. So, orbs with rings around them was it's own 
                        interest for about a week</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/hand.jpeg" alt="Best attempt at a hand"/>
            <figcaption>Like faces, I try to avoid drawing hands as much as possible, but out of all the ones that I've ever 
                        drawn this might be the one I'm the most okay with. In my typical style however, I had to make the
                        nails long and sharp. I don't often draw completely human things. I have a deep seated fascination
                        for things that imitate the human form.</figcaption>
        </figure>
       
        <figure>
            <img src="images/mushrooms.jpeg" alt="Longest Standing Series"/>
            <figcaption>My longest standing series of doodles was mushrooms. I was hooked on drawing mushrooms for like 
                        2 months for some reason. I guess I felt that they had so many different application with the drawings
                        that I could've made. For the tree on the right I felt like drawing something a little fancier I think.
                        So I gave it some flowers and vines as well as I adorned the area around the base and called it a day.</figcaption>
