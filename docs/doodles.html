        <h1>Doodles I've Done In Class</h1>
        
        <p>Something about me that I've been doing ever since I could rember is doodling in the middle of class. I scarcely
            actually draw anything outside of that. The only exception is when I'm supposede to be doing work but I got distracted
            because I started to doodle.</p>
        
        <h2>What does that mean?</h2>
        
        <p>It means I've collected quite the amount of doodles in all of my notebooks. While I'd love to be able to put them all
            here, that's not something that I can do. Mainly because I'm not proud of most of them but also because a lot of 
            the notebooks have been thrown away over the years. So the best that I'll be able to do it to show the one's I've 
            collected so far in my college notebooks.</p>
        
        <h2>How do I doodle?</h2>
        
        <p>As doodles imply, I only draw small quick things that can occupy my mind while I sit in class and half pay attention.
            There's typically three things that'll I typically doodle with one of those things consistently changing. They are as
            follows.</p>
        
       <ul>
           <li>Random shapes and vertices</li>
           <li>A certain thing that im interested in drawing: muskets, swords, masks, etc</li>
           <li>A random thing away from the thing im focused on</li>
       </ul>
