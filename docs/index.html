            <p>My main goal in life is to have my own independent game development studio where I can create my own ideas that 
                I have for games. Then, at the same time I want to be working on my too many book ideas. Maybe at some point I
                will be able my own workload I assigned for myself. In my spare time I love to read and play video games. Some other
                artistic endeavors that I like to do are Photography and poorly drawn doodles.</p>
