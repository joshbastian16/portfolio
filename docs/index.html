        <h1>Beginning HTML</h1>
        <nav>
            <a href="index.html">Home</a> | <a href="about.html">About</a> | <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>
            
        </nav>
        <h2>subheading</h2>
        <p>This is how you do a <a href="about.html">relative link</a> to a page inside the same folder.</p>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some
                <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text that would be bolded. Here is <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external
            website</a>.</p>
        <p>One of the best resources for learning HTML is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. 
            Here is a reference for how to use <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h3>What are block elements good for?</h3>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It's good for making a bulleted list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
       <h4>Different Block Element</h4> 
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code can look very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            The only way to see the difference is by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>noon</li>
            <li>afternoon</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>night</li>
        </ol>
